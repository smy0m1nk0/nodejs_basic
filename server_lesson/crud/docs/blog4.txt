What is the purpose of FullStack Development?
FullStack Development is the practice of developing both the front-end and back-end components of a software application. 
It involves working with both the client-side (such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and server-side 
(such as databases, APIs, and server frameworks) technologies to create a complete and functional application.
